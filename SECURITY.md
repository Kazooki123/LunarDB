# Security Policy

When spotting a bug, error or even a **Security Vulnerability**, it's very ideal to
report this immediately to the maintainer of **LunarDB**, the community, and to even the contributors.

## Supported Versions

**LunarDB** uses  Rust to compile source files into binary machine code. Which then users and developers around the World can execute.

Rust:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 2021    | :white_check_mark: |
| <2021   | :x:                |

**"<"** means below Rust 2021 edition, which is not supported for **LunarDB**

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Steps on how to `Report a Vulnerability`

1. Create a Issue
2. Explain how the bug works
